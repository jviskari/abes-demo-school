<h4>Part I, mod 13h</h4>
<hr>
<p>
Welcome to part I of the Demoschool. In the demoschool I'll guide you through different demoeffects such as paletterotation, 
plasma, fire, sprites, 3d-vector-graphics, shading, warping, mode-X, Soundblaster and whatever else that might show up.
Most parts of the demoschool will be in mode 13h or MCGA-mode as it is also called. That immediatly brings up the first question:

<h3>What is mode 13h?</h3>
Well, the answer is easy, mode 13h is the graphic mode of the PC that most games and demos are written for. The resolution
of mode 13h is <b>320</b> pixels horizontally and <b>200</b> pixels vertically. that makes 320*200 = 
64000 pixels totally on the screen. The pixels on the screen can have <b>256 different colours</b> (each pixel can actually only have
one colour at a time, but that colour can be one out of 256 colours in the palette). As you should know, one byte (8 bits) can take on 256 different
values. This means that each pixel in mode 13h could be represented by one byte, and that is also the case. Like I mentioned
mode 13h has 320*200 = 64000 pixels which is 64000 bytes. The screen-memory in mode 13h begins at adress 
A000:0000h, and ends at adress A000:FFFFh. This is 65535 bytes which leaves about 4 invisible rows below the bottom
of the screen. To <b>write a pixel</b> to the screen, first set segmentregister <b>ES to A000h</b> and 
calculate an <b>offset</b> and put it in <b>di</b> then write one <b>colorbyte to es:d</b>i. The offset is calculated like this:
<p>
<b>Offset = 320*y + x</b>
<p>
where x is the x-coordinate and y is the y-coordinate. <b>(0,0)</b> is at the <b>upper left</b> corner of the screen 
and <b>(319,199)</b> is at the <b>bottom right</b> corner of the screen. Here is a table of the coordinates and their respective offsets.
<pre>
	(0,0)	(1,0)	(2,0)	(3,0)	.	.	.	(319,0)
0	0	1	2	3	.	.	.	319	X-axis
1	320	321	322	323	.	.	.	639 (319,1)
2	640	641	642	643	.	.	.	959 (319,2)

	(0,199)	(1,199)	(2,199)	(3,199)	.	.	.	(319,199)
Y-axis
</pre>
Mode 13h is said to be in a <b>linear memory model</b> that means that the bytes follow each other one
after another.<br> 
To write a pixel with colour 1 (default blue) at (3,2) you should write value 1 to 
A000:(320*2 + 3) = A000h:643. Try it, it works. <p>Here comes an unoptimized example in C:
<pre>
void putpixel(int x,int y,char color)
{
 int offs;

offs=320*y + x;			//calculate the offset using the given formula
asm	mov	ax,0a000h	//you cant move a value directly to es
asm	mov	es,ax		//move the screenadress to es
asm	mov	di,offs		//and the calculated offset to di
asm	mov	al,color	//and the colorbyte to al
asm	mov	[es:di],al	//finally move the pixel to the screen
}
</pre>
Before putting a pixel to the screen you've gotta be in the MCGA-mode 13h.
<b>Switching into mode 13h</b> is done like this:
<pre>
	mov	ax,13h	;move the number of the mode to ax
	int	10h	;and enter the mode using the videointerrupt 10h
</pre>
<b>Switching back to textmode</b> 3 is done like this
<pre>
	mov	ax,3	;mode 3 is the dos standard mode 80*25 16 color textmode
	int	10h	;enter textmode 3
</pre>
Using inline assembly in C you could write a function to <b>change the mode</b> like this:
<pre>
void setmode(int mode)
{
asm	mov	ax,mode
asm	int	10h
}
</pre>
To switch into mode 13h you would write setmode(0x0013); at the beginning of main and to switch back 
into textmode write setmode(3);
<p>
To optimize the putpixel routine you could <b>replace the multiplication</b>, which is very slow, with <b>shifts and adds.</b>
As you should know, shifting left 1 bit is the same as multiplicating by 2, shiftleft 2 bits is the same as multiplicating 
by 4 and so on. The trick is to split 320 up into powers of 2, 320 is the same as (256 + 64). Y*320 is the 
same as (y leftshift 8) + (y leftshift 6). Look at the sourcecode for an implementation of the optimized 
putpixelroutine using inline-assembler in C.
<p>
What colour the pixel will have depends on two things: the colourvalue you write to the screen (0-255) and 
what colour that value represents in the palette. The palette has 256 entrys (0 to 255). Each colour in the palette 
is represented by three bytes, one each for the <b>Red, Green and Blue</b> component of the colour. Each value can
vary between <b>0 and 63</b>. The value gives the intensity of the colour, 0 no intensity, 63 strong intensity. This
gives 64^3 possible colours.

<br>Examples of common colours

	0	0	0	BLACK
	63	0	0	RED
	20	0	0	DARK RED
	0	63	0	GREEN
	0	0	63	BLUE
	63	63	0	YELLOW
	63	32	0	ORANGE
	63	0	63	PURPLE
	0	63	63	CYAN
	63	63	63	WHITE
	32	32	32	GRAY
	10	10	10	DARKGRAY
	And	So	On
</pre>
The MCGA mode 13h is always started with the same palett (0 black, 1 blue . . .). But it is easy to change the
palett by your own. It is done by writing to ports <b>3c8h</b> and <b>3c9h</b>. This is not as hard as it sounds.
You just write the <b>indexnumber</b> of the first color you intend to change to port <b>3c8h</b>. And then write the Red Green
and Blue <b>values to port 3c9h</b>. After writing 3 bytes to port 3c9h the index automatically increments itself.
<p>
If the palett is stored in an array pal (3*256 bytes long). Let's say that colour 0 is black, colour 1 is blue and
colour 2 is gray, then pal will start like this: 0,0,0, 0,0,63, 32,32,32, . . .
<br>
Here is a C-function which <b>sets the palette</b> to the values of the array pal:
<pre>
void setpal(char*pal)
{
 int i;
 outp(0x3C8,0);		//begin with colour 0
 for(i=0;i&lt;256*3;i++)
 outp(0x3C9,pal[i]);	//send the palette-data to port 3c9h
}
</pre>
The most common way of handling the palette is to make the array pal in a specially written program for the purpose
and save the palette to a file on disk. This palette file is easy to recognise because it is 3*256 = 768 bytes big.
In the demo you just load the palette file from disk to an array and sets it with the function above.
<p>
In assembler you can use a very fast instruction,<b> rep outsb</b>, to set the palette, rep outsb sends CX number of bytes
from DS:SI and sends them to port DX. SI is incremented after each byte.
Here comes an assembler routine to set the entire palette.
<pre>
	mov	dx,03c8h	;move portnumber to dx
	xor	al,al		;reset ax
	out	dx,al		;send 0 to port 3c8h
	lds	si,pal		;setup ds:si to point to pal
	mov	cx,3*256	;move number of bytes to cx
	inc	dx		;dx = 3c9h
	rep	outsb		;send 768 bytes from pal to port 3c9h
</pre>
A common demoeffect is to repeatidly <b>rotate the array </b>pal and calling <b>setpal(pal)</b>. Among other effects 
you could use this technique to make a <b>static plasma</b> effect. First setup the array pal to contain smooth 
colour runs between some nice colours. Then draw a nice picture on the screen using the sine and cosine
functions and at last rotate the palette and set it over and over again.
<p>
The picture doesn't have to be a plasma picture you could draw just any picture and watch how it looks when
the palette starts rotating. To rotate the array pal just <b>save the first colour</b> (the first three bytes) and then
<b>shift</b> all colours <b>down one step</b> in the array (three bytes) and at last <b>set the last colour</b> to the saved colour.
Here's the C-code for rotating the palette. (it actually rotates colours first to last in the palette)
<pre>
void rotpal(char*pal,int first, int last)
{
 char r,g,b;
 int i;

 r=pal[first*3 + 0];	//set r,g,b to the first colour
 g=pal[first*3 + 1];
 b=pal[first*3 + 2];

 for(i=first*3;i&lt;(last+1)*3;i++) //move all colours down one step
 pal[i]=pal[i+3];

 pal[last*3+0]=r;	//set the last colour to the saved first colour
 pal[last*3+1]=g;
 pal[last*3+2]=b;

 wtsync();	//wait until the electron beam finishes this frame
 setpal(pal);	//set the rotated pal
}
</pre>
You don't have to send first and last as parameters to the function but it has some advantages. In the
example program I use an array that has more than 256 colours and each time I rotate the entire palette, 
except colour 0, but I only set the 256 first colours. I don't rotate colour 0 because I dont want the backgroundcolour
to change. Try including colour 0 in the rotation to see what I mean.
The wtsync function should always be called before changing the palette to avoid "snow" due to bad syncronization
with the electron beam. Wtsync waits for the<b> vertical retrace</b> which is when the electron beam has finished one frame
and jumps back to draw the next.
You could say that the example program is halfway to a real plasma effect, I'll show you a real plasma in
a later part of the demoschool.
<p>
That sould be all for now, look at the C-source for more comments and the implementation.

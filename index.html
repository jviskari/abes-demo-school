<h2>Abe's Demoschool</h2>
<br>
The <a href="asmpys.htm">swedish
version</a> of Abe's demoschool has existed since the fall of 94, when I
began studying computer science at Mälardalens University in Västerås Sweden 
and got access to the web. Many of the accesses to the demoschool have
been from out of sweden so now I'ts time for an English version. 
It won't contain the Assembly-school, only the demo-school. So before
digging deeper into the wonderful world of demo-programming I suggest you 
get some basic understanding of PC-assembly. A good book on the subject 
is <b>Mastering Turbo Assembler</b> by Tom Swan. If you don't have the
money to buy a 900+ paged book you could take a look at the  <a href="asmvla.zip">Assembly 
tutors</a> by Draeden of VLA. <h4>Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>A PC compatible computer, at least a <b>386</b> equipped with MS-DOS
<li>A <b>C-compiler for MS-DOS</b> such as Borland C++ 3.1, Turbo C or Watcom C.
<li>An assembler, I use Borland <b>Turbo Assembler.</b> (tasm, tlink)
</ul>
I have a 486 dx2 66Mhz and I also try all the programs on a 486 dx 33. I
have no idea of what the demos will look like on  a slower machine but
most people do have 486:s nowadays. The programs will need <b><i>at least
a 386</i></b> to run.<br> The C-compiler shouldn't make much difference but please, if you don't have Turbo Assembler, <b>GET IT</b>, because I'll use Turbo Assembler specific <b>IDEAL MODE</b> code. 
Turbo Assembler comes with most of Borlands compilers, for instance 
Borland C++, Turbo C, Turbo Pascal and so on.
<p>
Well now, after all that requirement crap I expect you have equipped youself with the assembly basics. You now should
be ready to enter the Demoschool. Part I will explain the basics of demo-programming and then, in the following parts,  
I will guide you through some of those effects you've seen in all those great demos out there.
<p>
<h3>The Demoschool</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="abedemo1.html">Part 
I</a>. Getting into demomode, rotating the palette and more. . .
<li><a href="abedemo2.htm">Part 
II</a> Fades, lookup-tables &amp; virtual screen
<li><a href="abedemo3.htm">Part 
III</a> Sprites, Mixing C &amp; Assembler
<li><a href="abedemo4.htm"> Part IV</a> 
 3D-rotation, perspective projection, fixed point math, sorting
<li><a href="abedemo5.htm">
Part V</a> Lens and similar effects, color quantification.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Bag of Tricks</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="svga.htm">svga 
putpixel</a> A small C program that demonstrates a way to put a pixel in 
svga mode 640*480 256 colors
<li><a href="bag2.htm"> Working
SVGA putpixel</a>. VESA detection, faster (and working) bankswitching.
</ul>
